# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# First_name = "Sam "
# Last_name = "Smith"

# print(First_name + Last_name)

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first_name = "John"
# last_name = "Doe"

# print(f"{first_name} {last_name}")

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".m

# Get the user's input
word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Check if the word is "marco"

    print("polo!")
