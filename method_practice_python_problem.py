# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# print(word.upper())

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.
# number = input("please type in a number: ")
# if int(number) > 100:
#     print("Thats a big a number")
# else:
#     print("Thats a small number")

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

number1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
number2 = input("Enter the second number: ")

sum = int(number1) + int(number2)

print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum)
